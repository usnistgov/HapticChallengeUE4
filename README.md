* SWAT - Active Shooter
  - This scenario simulates an active shooter situation in which SWAT must engage several individuals in an underground parking garage.
* EMS - Mass Casualty Triage
  - During this scenario EMS must perform triage at a mass casualty traffic collision and determine vitals while in the extremely noisy environment.
